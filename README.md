# ðŸš€ Built a Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game! ðŸŽ®  

Excited to share my latest projectâ€”a **Tic-Tac-Toe web application** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**! This interactive game lets players compete against each other, with smooth UI interactions and real-time game state tracking.  

ðŸ”¹ **Features:**  
âœ… **Interactive Gameplay** â€“ Players take turns marking the 3Ã—3 grid.  
âœ… **Win Detection** â€“ Checks for a winner or a draw after every move.  
âœ… **Reset Functionality** â€“ Restart the game with a single click.  
âœ… **Responsive UI** â€“ Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.  
âœ… **Smooth Animations** â€“ Enhanced with CSS for a better experience.  

ðŸ”— **Play the live game here:** [Tic-Tac-Toe Live](https://tic-tak-toe-x-o.netlify.app/)  
ðŸ”— **GitHub Repository:** [[GitHub Link]  ](https://github.com/puravdhanki/PRODIGY_WD_03)

### ðŸš€ My Experience  
I really enjoyed working on this project as part of my internship at **[@Prodigy Infotech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodigy-infotech/)**. The game logic, UI responsiveness, and overall smoothness were my key focus areas.  

### ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Next?  
Looking forward to adding:  
ðŸ”¹ **Winning row highlight** for better visibility.  
ðŸ”¹ **Single-player mode with AI** for solo gameplay.  
ðŸ”¹ **Score counter** to track wins per session.  

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback! Try out the game and let me know what you think in the comments. ðŸ˜Š
